                <p>I am interested in a lot of things, and I try my best to find like-minded people to share my
                    interests with.
                    This is a list of all the things I'm involved in from most to least recent (by ending and starting

                <h3>Student Politics</h3>

                <p>Interested in improving the lives of students and having a say in issues at the University, I have
                    gotten involved
                    in student societies and committees. </p>

                <p>In first year I was a First Year Representative for both semesters, and going into
                    second year I will be a Computer Science Representative. In addition to the responsibilities that
                    come with
                    those positions, I am also chair of the Policy Committee (a committee that is investigating changes
                    to the way that the Mathematics Society operates) and was one of 3 people responsible for
                    recommending
                    the Vice President Finance for the Summer 2014 semester.</p>

                <p>In addition to my work with the Mathematics Society, I am also involved with the Math Endowment Fund
                    through
                    my seat on their Board of Directors.</p>
                <a href="http://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mefcom/about/index.html" target="_blank">

                    </div>
                </a>

                <p>Finally, I have a seat as the Computer Science Representative on the Undergraduate Affairs Committee,
                    which reports
                    to the Faculty Council of the Department of Mathematics and follows its responsibilities in
