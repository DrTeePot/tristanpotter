            <h3>Student Politics</h3>

            <p>Interested in improving the lives of students and having a say in issues at the University, I have
                gotten involved
                in student societies and committees. </p>

            <p>In first year I was a First Year Representative for both semesters, and going into
                second year I will be a Computer Science Representative. In addition to the responsibilities that come
                with
                those positions, I am also chair of the Policy Committee (a committee that is investigating changes
                to the way that the Mathematics Society operates) and was one of 3 people responsible for recommending
                the Vice President Finance for the Summer 2014 semester.</p>

            <p>In addition to my work with the Mathematics Society, I am also involved with the Math Endowment Fund
                through
                my seat on their Board of Directors.</p>
            <a href="http://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mefcom/about/index.html" target="_blank">
                <div class="blockquote-reverse">"The Math Endowment Fund is an income-generating
                    fund that finances projects for the academic betterment of mathematics undergraduate students at
                    the University of Waterloo."
                </div>
            </a>

            <p>Finally, I have a seat as the Computer Science Representative on the Undergraduate Affairs Committee,
                which reports
                to the Faculty Council of the Department of Mathematics and follows its responsibilities in
